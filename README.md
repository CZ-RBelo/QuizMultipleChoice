# Quiz Multiple-Choice Questions

### Repository description

This is an application that intends to simulate a timed Quiz with multiple-choice questions.  
When the game ends, it displays the highest scores and gives the user the ability to save their initials and their score.  
The application has a mobile-responsive user interface that will run in the browser and will present dynamically updated HTML and CSS through JavaScript code.

## Instructions

When the user presses the start button a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
* Each multiple-choice question contains buttons for each answer;
* When the answer is clicked, the next question appears;
* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract 10 seconds from the timer.

The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
